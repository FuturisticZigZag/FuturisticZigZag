Hello!

My name is Kirill and I'm a front-end development student living in Jönköping, Sweden.
I'm in my first year of education and don't have that much experience... yet.
So far, working with CSS has been the part i have enjoyed the most.

More information will come when I i get more experience and learn more cool front-end stuff!
